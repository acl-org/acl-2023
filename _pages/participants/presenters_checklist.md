# Find out When Your Paper is Scheduled

We also have the same information on Miniconf (as in previous conferences, this will be updated but the handbook will not):
[https://virtual2023.aclweb.org/schedule.html](https://virtual2023.aclweb.org/schedule.html)

Please check to make sure your paper is where you expect it to be (and in the mode you expect).

# In-person Oral

Double-check the detailed presentation [instructions from Underline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NsSjVd0Wung2rMft42PsRdTK939pJ8PwKYmzOk-G6U8/edit) ahead of the conference to make sure you have submitted all the required materials. You should upload your slides at the latest by the end of the day before your presentation.

Arrive 15 minutes prior to your session and introduce yourself to the session chair. Give your live presentation at the scheduled time.

Check your paper’s RocketChat channel during the conference to engage with questions and comments from audience members.

# Virtual Oral Presentation

Double-check the detailed presentation [instructions from Underline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NsSjVd0Wung2rMft42PsRdTK939pJ8PwKYmzOk-G6U8/edit) ahead of the conference to make sure you have submitted all the required materials.  You should upload your slides at the latest by the end of the day before your presentation.

Join the Zoom room linked from the Underline schedule 15 minutes before the session start. The Underline staff will be there to greet you. You will present by sharing your screen and you will have a chance to answer questions. You are advised to present live.

Check your paper’s page on RocketChat during the conference to engage with questions and comments from audience members.

# In-Person Findings Spotlights

Double-check the detailed presentation [instructions from Underline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NsSjVd0Wung2rMft42PsRdTK939pJ8PwKYmzOk-G6U8/edit) ahead of the conference to make sure you have submitted all the required materials.  In particular, you should only put one slide in your "slides" upload for Findings spotlight.  Underline will compile this together into a single slide deck.

The chair of the spotlight session will order the spotlights based on the program and will give you instructions on where to sit before the session starts (so arrive early!) and sit in the correct order.

# Main Conference In-Person Poster Presentation

Double-check the detailed presentation [instructions from Underline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NsSjVd0Wung2rMft42PsRdTK939pJ8PwKYmzOk-G6U8/edit) ahead of the conference to make sure you have submitted all the required materials.  You should upload your slides at the latest by the end of the day before your presentation.

If you have opted to present your poster in person in addition to virtually, your poster should be in a portrait A0 format. Each paper is assigned to a specific board to ensure that posters are grouped by area. The assignment will be displayed in the room. Put up your poster at least 15 minutes before the start of your session, and take it down at the end of your presentation. Pins will be provided. ACL does not have poster printing services, you are responsible for making arrangements for printing your poster.  ACL used [this printer](https://robinsonevents.ca/ep_item_ss/1686761448081x639287012229120000) for some printing.

# Virtual Poster (Main Conference and Findings)

Double-check the detailed presentation [instructions from Underline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NsSjVd0Wung2rMft42PsRdTK939pJ8PwKYmzOk-G6U8/edit) ahead of the conference to make sure you have submitted all the required materials.  You should upload your slides at the latest by the end of the day before your presentation.

Join Gathertown ahead of time following the link for your session on the Underline conference schedule. To foster discussion, posters are grouped by area. In Gathertown, follow the arrows to your area. Stand next to your poster and interact with the audience.

Check your paper’s channel on RocketChat during the conference to engage with questions and comments from audience members.

# Last-minute Changes to Presentation Mode

We will do our best to accomodate changes with 48 hours notice.

In case of travel disruptions, presenters can request switching from in person to virtual presentation mode as described below.

You can adjust your registration mode and fee by contacting aclinfo@yesevents.com or Toll Free: +1-800-937-8728. See [https://2023.aclweb.org/registration/](https://2023.aclweb.org/registration/) for details.

If you are presenting orally: you can present remotely on Underline rather than in person as long you follow the instructions for virtual presenters provided here. There is no need to notify the Program Chairs nor Underline in this case.

Contact tutorial or workshop chairs for presentations outside the main conference.

For anything else, please submit a [change of modality form](https://forms.office.com/r/1zqrZBaTEM).
