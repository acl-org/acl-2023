The ACL 2023 Student Research Workshop (SRW) is a forum to bring together students investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community.

The workshop's goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research.


## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 ("anywhere on Earth").

## General Rules for Submission

We invite papers in two different categories:

* Research Papers: Papers in this category can describe completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results. For these papers, the first author **MUST BE** a current student (graduate or undergraduate). Topics of interest for the SRW are the same as for the [main ACL 2023 conference](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/main_conference/).
* Thesis Proposals: This category is appropriate for PhD students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work.

Submissions (in both categories) may either be archival or non-archival, based on the wish of the authors. All archival papers will be published in the ACL 2023 SRW Proceedings. Non-archival papers may be submitted to any venue in the future except for another SRW.
The submission links are on [our website](https://acl2023-srw.github.io/). Please read the guidelines carefully.

## Why Submit to ACL SRW?

There are many good reasons to submit to the ACL SRW, such as:

* Mentorship program: ACL SRW provides a unique opportunity for students to receive constructive feedback and to improve their work through a pre-submission mentorship program.
* Improving your publication record: publishing a paper as an undergraduate or as a MSc/MA student is beneficial when applying for a PhD program. Publishing a paper in an ACL SRW workshop can be really helpful for improving students’ publication record.
* Explorative Studies: We encourage the submission of studies with positive and negative results providing insights on why and in which scenarios a particular method succeeds and fails.

All accepted papers and thesis proposals will be presented either as oral presentations or during poster sessions, which will give students an opportunity to interact with and to present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field and assigned mentors.

## Pre-Submission Mentorship Program

The SRW offers students the opportunity to receive feedback prior to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student's work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged. The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.

Students wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft by March 10, 2023.

Note that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be anonymized. We will check for the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.

The participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and will provide feedback within four weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.

You CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper. The submission website will have separate tracks for pre-submission mentorship and the final paper submission.

## Submission Requirements

We accept both archival submissions (which will be included in the conference proceedings) and non-archival submissions (which will be presented at the workshop but will not be included in the proceedings).

All submissions (archival and non-archival) must follow the anonymity period and the restrictions of the main conference.

Long papers consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus an unlimited number of pages for references and supplementary material like the appendix. Upon acceptance, papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages).

Short papers consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus an unlimited number of pages for references and supplementary material like the appendix. Upon acceptance, papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages).

Authors are encouraged to use the additional page to address reviewers’ comments.
Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crtcwgxzjskr) and also [downloadable directly](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates) (Latex and Word). We strongly encourage participants to use the Latex template. All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in these template files. The review process will be double-blind, and thus all submissions must be anonymized.

The SRW invites papers on topics related to computational linguistics, including but not limited to the following:

* Computational Social Science and Social Media
* Dialogue and Interactive Systems
* Discourse and Pragmatics
* Ethics and NLP
* Information Extraction
* Information Retrieval and Text Mining
* Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
* Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics, and Beyond
* Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics
* Machine Learning for NLP
* Machine Translation and Multilinguality
* NLP Applications
* Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation
* Question Answering
* Resources and Evaluation
* Semantics: Lexical
* Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference, and Other Areas
* Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining
* Speech and Multimodality
* Summarization
* Syntax: Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing

## Grants

We expect to have grants to offset some portion of students' travel, conference registration, and accommodation expenses. Further details will be posted on the SRW website.
